# ðŸš€ AI/ML Model Monitoring Dashboard

Welcome to the **AI/ML Model Monitoring Dashboard**! This project provides a user-friendly interface to monitor the performance, data drift, and target drift of your machine learning models in real-time. Built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Evidently AI**, this dashboard is designed to help you keep track of your model's health and make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Data Drift Analysis**: Monitor changes in feature distributions over time.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Track key regression metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².
- **Target Drift Analysis**: Visualize changes in the target variable distribution.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Use Plotly to create interactive and insightful charts.
- **Upload New Data**: Easily upload new datasets for monitoring.
- **Evidently AI Reports**: Generate detailed reports for data drift, model performance, and target drift.
